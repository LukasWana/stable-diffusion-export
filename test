Basics of Prompt Engineering
A guide by Graverman
Today I propose a simple formula for beginners to use and create better generations with text to image AI. This was tested on stable diffusion but it should work on any model if it was trained on enough art data.

After reading this document and applying these simple steps, you’ll be able to generate better images with the same amount of effort.


1. Raw prompt
Raw prompt is the simplest way of describing what you want to generate, for instance;

Panda
A warrior with a sword
Skeleton
This is the basic building block of any prompt. Most new people start by only using raw prompts, this is usually a mistake as the images you generate like this tend to get random and chaotic. Here are some examples that I generated with running the earlier prompts





As you can see, these images have random scenery and don’t look very aesthetically pleasing, I definitely wouldn’t consider them art. This brings me to my next point;


2. Style
Style is a crucial part of the prompt. The AI, when missing a specified style, usually chooses the one it has seen the most in related images, for example, if I generated landscape, it would probably generate realistic or oil painting looking images. Having a well chosen style + raw prompt is sometimes enough, as the style influences the image the most right after the raw prompt.

The most commonly used styles include:

Realistic
Oil painting
Pencil drawing
Concept art
I’ll examine them one by one to give an overview on how you might use these styles.

In the case of a realistic image, there are various ways of making it the style, most resulting in similar images. Here are some commonly used techniques of making the image realistic:

a photo of + raw prompt
a photograph of + raw prompt
raw prompt, hyperrealistic
raw prompt, realistic
You can of course combine these to get more and more realistic images.

To get oil painting you can just simply add “an oil painting of” to your prompt. This sometimes results in the image showing an oil painting in a frame, to fix this you can just re-run the prompt or use raw prompt + “oil painting”

To make a pencil drawing just simply add “a pencil drawing of” to your raw prompt or make your prompt raw prompt + “pencil drawing”.

The same applies to landscape art.



3. Artist
To make your style more specific, or the image more coherent, you can use artists’ names in your prompt. For instance, if you want a very abstract image, you can add “made by Pablo Picasso” or just simply, “Picasso”.

Below are lists of artists in different styles that you can use, but I always encourage you to search for different artists as it is a cool way of discovering new art.

Portrait

John Singer Sargent
Edgar Degas
Paul Cézanne
Jan van Eyck
Oil painting

Leonardo DaVinci
Vincent Van Gogh
Johannes Vermeer
Rembrandt
Pencil/Pen drawing

Albrecht Dürer
Leonardo da Vinci
Michelangelo
Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres
Landscape art

Thomas Moran
Claude Monet
Alfred Bierstadt
Frederic Edwin Church
Mixing the artists is highly encouraged, as it can lead to interesting-looking art.



4. Finishing touches
This is the part that some people take to extremes, leading to longer prompts than this article. Finishing touches are the final things that you add to your prompt to make it look like you want. For instance, if you want to make your image more artistic, add “trending on artstation”. If you want to add more realistic lighting add “Unreal Engine.” You can add anything you want, but here are some examples:

Highly detailed, surrealism, trending on art station, triadic color scheme, smooth, sharp focus, matte, elegant, the most beautiful image ever seen, illustration, digital paint, dark, gloomy, octane render, 8k, 4k, washed colors, sharp, dramatic lighting, beautiful, post processing, picture of the day, ambient lighting, epic composition



5. Conclusion
Prompt engineering allows you to have better control of what the image will look like. It (if done right) improves the image quality by a lot in every aspect. If you enjoyed this “article”, well, I’m glad I didn’t waste my time. If you see any ways that I can improve this, definitely let me know on discord (Graverman#0804)

## Snehurka
A fair princess indeed, Snow White was named for the colour of her skin, which was white as snow, hair as black as ebony, and lips as red as a rose. Her father, having lost his wife, married again, and this new queen was as beautiful as she was proud. She would often consult her mirror and ask “Mirror Mirror, on the wall; Who is the fairest of them all?”

As Snow White began to grow, she became more and more beautiful, and the queen’s magic mirror soon began to say so. Enraged and filled with jealousy, the queen sent a huntsman to kill Snow White and bring her her heart.

The Huntsman, pitying the innocent Snow White, told her to run away and never come back. He, instead, delivered to the queen the heart of a pig. When the queen consulted her mirror and found that she had been tricked, she determined to kill Snow White herself and so began to prepare her poisoned apple.

Snow White, in the meantime, found a place with seven dwarfs, whom she lived with and cared for. One day, when they were at work in the mines, the queen went to see Snow White, disguised as an old peasant woman selling apples. Snow White was convinced to take a bite out of the apple and instantly fell down, as if dead. When the dwarfs found her, they were distraught and laid her in a glass coffin.

One day, as a prince was passing by, he noticed the dwarfs mourning over a beautiful sleeping girl (for she remained as beautiful as she ever was) and was mesmerised by her beauty. He kissed her hand to bid her farewell, and at that moment, the apple dislodged itself, and Snow White opened her eyes. The prince was so happy that he asked for her hand in marriage and she accepted. There was a grand celebration, and they lived and reigned happily together. The evil queen became sick from her envy and eventually died.

We must always remember, from the fate of the queen, that if you lust after physical beauty, you will, indeed lose your peace, and be quite unhappy when you are not considered the most beautiful. On the contrary, kindness and gentleness win the hearts of many.

The story of Cinderella tells of a kindhearted young woman who was treated cruelly by her stepmother and sisters, but, never the less, kept a humble attitude.

One day, the king decided to throw a ball and invited all the young maidens in the kingdom. While Cinderella’s sisters made her help them get ready for the ball, not once did they ask her if she would like to go with them.

Once they left, her Fairy Godmother appeared and helped Cinderella go to the ball with a bit of magic that would only last until midnight. At the ball, Cinderella caught the eye of the prince, as she was the most beautiful girl there, and they danced all night.

When midnight came, Cinderella had to leave the ball, and in her hurry, one of her glass slippers fell off her feet. The prince found this slipper and vowed to marry the girl who the slipper belonged to.

The prince went from house to house, looking for the girl who’s foot fit the slipper, and he reached Cinderella’s house. Though Cinderella’s stepsisters and stepmother tried to keep her from trying it on, the glass slipper was a perfect fit, and she was soon married to the prince and lived happily ever after.
This is a wonderful story that captures how keeping a humble attitude will reap its rewards.
